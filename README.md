polymorphic-splitting-port
==========================

A Racket port of Suresh Jagannathan's and Andrew Wright's Polymorphic Splitting implementation.

The main functionality is driven by drivers.rkt
The analysis is for R4RS Scheme code, so don't be alarmed when the generated code does not run in Racket.
